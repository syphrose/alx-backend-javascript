JAVASCRIPT DATA MANIPULATION

ARRAY
In JavaScript, arrays aren't primitives but are instead Array objects with the following core characteristics:

JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. (When those characteristics are undesirable, use typed arrays instead.)
JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays and so, array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes, but must be accessed using nonnegative integers (or their respective string form) as indexes.
JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on â€” and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.
JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).
Array indices
Array objects cannot use arbitrary strings as element indexes (as in an associative array) but must use nonnegative integers (or their respective string form). Setting or accessing via non-integers will not set or retrieve an element from the array list itself, but will set or access a variable associated with that array's object property collection. The array's object properties and list of array elements are separate, and the array's traversal and mutation operations cannot be applied to these named properties.

Array elements are object properties in the same way that toString is a property (to be specific, however, toString() is a method). Nevertheless, trying to access an element of an array as follows throws a syntax error because the property name is not valid:

arr.0; // a syntax error

JavaScript syntax requires properties beginning with a digit to be accessed using bracket notation instead of dot notation. It's also possible to quote the array indices (e.g., years['2'] instead of years[2]), although usually not necessary.

The 2 in years[2] is coerced into a string by the JavaScript engine through an implicit toString conversion. As a result, '2' and '02' would refer to two different slots on the years object, and the following example could be true:

console.log(years["2"] !== years["02"]);

Only years['2'] is an actual array index. years['02'] is an arbitrary string property that will not be visited in array iteration.

SET OBJECTS

Set objects are collections of values. A value in the set may only occur once; it is unique in the set's collection. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order. The insertion order corresponds to the order in which each element was inserted into the set by the add() method successfully (that is, there wasn't an identical element already in the set when add() was called).

The specification requires sets to be implemented "that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on the number of elements in the collection". Therefore, it could be represented internally as a hash table (with O(1) lookup), a search tree (with O(log(N)) lookup), or any other data structure, as long as the complexity is better than O(N).

Set-like objects
All set composition methods require this to be an actual Set instance, but their arguments just need to be set-like. A set-like object is an object that provides the following:

A size property that contains a number.
A has() method that takes an element and returns a boolean.
A keys() method that returns an iterator of the elements in the set.

Constructor
Set()
Creates a new Set object.

Static properties
Set[@@species]
The constructor function that is used to create derived objects.

Instance properties
These properties are defined on Set.prototype and shared by all Set instances.

Set.prototype.constructor
The constructor function that created the instance object. For Set instances, the initial value is the Set constructor.

Set.prototype.size
Returns the number of values in the Set object.

Set.prototype[@@toStringTag]
The initial value of the @@toStringTag property is the string "Set". This property is used in Object.prototype.toString().

Instance methods
Set.prototype.add()
Inserts a new element with a specified value in to a Set object, if there isn't an element with the same value already in the Set.

Set.prototype.clear()
Removes all elements from the Set object.

Set.prototype.delete()
Removes the element associated to the value and returns a boolean asserting whether an element was successfully removed or not. Set.prototype.has(value) will return false afterwards.

Set.prototype.difference() Experimental
Takes a set and returns a new set containing elements in this set but not in the given set.

Set.prototype.entries()
Returns a new iterator object that contains an array of [value, value] for each element in the Set object, in insertion order. This is similar to the Map object, so that each entry's key is the same as its value for a Set.

Set.prototype.forEach()
Calls callbackFn once for each value present in the Set object, in insertion order. If a thisArg parameter is provided, it will be used as the this value for each invocation of callbackFn.

Set.prototype.has()
Returns a boolean asserting whether an element is present with the given value in the Set object or not.

Set.prototype.intersection() Experimental
Takes a set and returns a new set containing elements in both this set and the given set.

Set.prototype.isDisjointFrom() Experimental
Takes a set and returns a boolean indicating if this set has no elements in common with the given set.

Set.prototype.isSubsetOf() Experimental
Takes a set and returns a boolean indicating if all elements of this set are in the given set.

Set.prototype.isSupersetOf() Experimental
Takes a set and returns a boolean indicating if all elements of the given set are in this set.

Set.prototype.keys()
An alias for Set.prototype.values().

Set.prototype.symmetricDifference() Experimental
Takes a set and returns a new set containing elements which are in either this set or the given set, but not in both.

Set.prototype.union() Experimental
Takes a set and returns a new set containing elements which are in either or both of this set and the given set.

Set.prototype.values()
Returns a new iterator object that yields the values for each element in the Set object in insertion order.

Set.prototype[@@iterator]()
Returns a new iterator object that yields the values for each element in the Set object in insertion order.
